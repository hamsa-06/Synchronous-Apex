Update Contact Address with Account Address
As a Salesforce Admin, I want to update all associated Contacts' addresses whenever the Account's address is updated so that the data remains consistent.
Input- account id,output - get the list of contact related to the account and update the mailing address of te contact with parent account 
Acceptance Criteria:
- An Apex trigger or class executes synchronously whenever the Account address fields are updated.
- All related Contacts' address fields are updated to match the Account's address fields.

public with sharing class ContactUpdate {
    public static void updateContact(String accId){
        Account acc = [SELECT Id,BillingAddress FROM Account WHERE Id =: accId];
        List<Contact> lstOfContact = [SELECT Id,MailingAddress FROM Contact WHERE AccountId =:accId];
        if(lstOfContact.size() > 0){
            for(Contact con:lstOfContact){
                con.MailingCity = acc.BillingCity;
                con.MailingCountry = acc.BillingCountry;
                con.MailingState = acc.BillingState;
                con.MailingPostalCode = acc.BillingPostalCode;
            }
            update lstOfContact;
        }
    }
}
