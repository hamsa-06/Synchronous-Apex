Send Welcome Email to New Customers
As a Customer Success Manager, I want an email sent automatically to a customer after their record is created so that they feel welcomed.
Input - Customer id,Output - Send Hi email
Acceptance Criteria:
- When a new Contact record is created, an Apex class runs synchronously to send a **Welcome Email**.
- The email includes the customer's name and a standard message template.

public with sharing class MailContact {
    public static void insertRecord(String name,String accountId,String email,String phone){
        Contact con = new Contact();
        con.LastName = name;
        con.AccountId = accountId;
        con.Email = email;
        con.Phone = phone;
        sendMail(email,name);
        insert con;
    }
    public static void sendMail(String email,String name){
       Messaging.SingleEmailMessage mail = new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage();
       String[] toaddresses = new String[] {email}; 
       mail.setToAddresses(toaddresses);
       mail.setSubject('Welcome To Our Company');
       mail.setPlainTextBody('Hello '+name+','+'\n\n'+'Welcome to our company! We Glad To Have You On Board.' +'\n\n'+'Best Regards,'+'\n'+'Hamsa');
       Messaging.sendEmail(new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage[] {mail});
    }
}
