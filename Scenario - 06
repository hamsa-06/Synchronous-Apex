Generate Unique Invoice Number
User Story:
As an Invoice Manager, I want a unique Invoice Number generated for each new Invoice record so that I can easily identify them.
Acceptance Criteria:
- When a new Invoice record is created, an Apex class assigns a unique Invoice Number in the format INV-{YYYYMM}-{0001}.
- The Invoice Number field is auto-populated and non-editable after creation.
Input - case record type if it is external auto number should be EXT - 0000, internal auto number be INT - 0000

public with sharing class InvoiceNumber {
    public static void invoiceNumber(){
        List<Case> lstExtId = [SELECT RecordTypeId__c,RecordType.DeveloperName from Case];
        Integer i =0;
        Integer j = 0;
        for(Case c : lstExtId){
            if(c.RecordType.DeveloperName == 'Internal'){
                c.RecordTypeId__c = 'INT - 0'+i;
                i++;
            }
            else{
                c.RecordTypeId__c ='EXT - 0'+j;
                j++;
            }
        }
        update lstExtId;
    }
}
