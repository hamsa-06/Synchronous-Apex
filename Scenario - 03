Auto-close Case After Resolution
As a Support Agent,
I want to automatically set the Status of a Case to "Closed" once the resolution is added,
So that I can reduce manual steps.
Acceptance Criteria:
Input: Case ID with Resolution field filled.
Output: Status is updated to "Closed" immediately.

public with sharing class CaseResolution {
    public static void resoltuion(String cn){
        Case c = [SELECT id,Reason,Priority,Resolution__c FROM Case WHERE CaseNumber =: cn];
        if(c.Reason == 'Installation' && c.Priority =='Medium'){
            c.Resolution__c = 'Assigned an Sales rep';
            c.Status = 'Closed';
            update c;
        }
    }
}
