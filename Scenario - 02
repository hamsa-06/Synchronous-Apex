Count Open Cases for Each Account
As a Customer Service Manager,
I want to see the number of open Cases related to each Account,
So that I can prioritize which customers need the most support.
Acceptance Criteria:
Input: Account ID.
Output: Open_Case_Count__c field on Account is updated synchronously.

public with sharing class CountOpenCase {
    public static void openCase(String id){
        Account a = [SELECT id,Name FROM Account WHERE Id =:id LIMIT 1];
        List<Case> cs = [SELECT id,status FROM Case WHERE AccountId =:id];
        Integer count = 0;
        for(Case c:cs){
            if(c.Status != 'Closed'){
                count = count + 1;
            }
        }
        a.NumberOfOpenCase__c = count;
        update a;
    }   
}
