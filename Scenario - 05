Create Related Tasks When Opportunity is Won
As a Sales Rep,
I want to create a predefined set of follow-up Tasks when an Opportunity is marked as "Closed Won",
So that I can streamline my process.
Acceptance Criteria:
Input: Opportunity ID.
Output: Three tasks created: Thank You Call, Upsell Opportunity, and Delivery Coordination.

public with sharing class CreateTaskWonOpp {
    public static void task(){
        List<Opportunity> opp = [SELECT id,StageName,AccountId FROM Opportunity WHERE StageName =: 'Closed Won'];
        List<Task> taskList = new List<Task>();
        for(Opportunity o:opp){
            if(o.StageName == 'Closed Won'){
                Task t = new Task();
                t.Subject = 'Follow up on Closed Won Opportunity';
                t.WhatId = o.Id;
                taskList.add(t);
            }
        }
        insert taskList;
    }
}
