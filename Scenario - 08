Calculate Discounts on Opportunity
As a Sales Manager, I want a custom button on the Opportunity page to calculate a discount percentage based on the total opportunity amount so that I can quickly offer deals to clients.
Acceptance Criteria:
- A button labeled "Calculate Discount" is available on the Opportunity record.
- Clicking the button runs an Apex class that calculates the discount:
- 5% for amounts above $10,000.
- 10% for amounts above $50,000.
- The discount is saved in a custom field called Discount__c.

public with sharing class OpportunityDiscount {
   public static Double calculateDis(Decimal amt){
        Double amountAfterDiscount = 0;
        if(amt<10000){
            amountAfterDiscount = amt;
        }
        else if(amt>=10000 && amt<50000){
            amountAfterDiscount = amt - (amt *0.05);
        }
        else if(amt>=50000 && amt<100000){
            amountAfterDiscount = amt - (amt *0.10);
        }
        else if(amt >=100000){
            amountAfterDiscount = amt - (amt *0.15);
        }
        return amountAfterDiscount;
   }
   public static void setDiscount(String oppId){
        Opportunity op = [SELECT Id,Amount,Discount__c FROM Opportunity WHERE Id = : oppId];
        if(op != null){
            Double discount = calculateDis(op.Amount);
            op.Discount__c = discount;
            update op;
        }
   }
}
